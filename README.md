  <strong>Roblox sandbox physics game with logic and destruction</strong>
</p>

A sandbox physics game on Roblox centered around constructing mechanical and logical machines. From planes to cars to wild hybrids, from mini-processors to guided missiles — build anything you want, then test it in a dynamic and destructible world.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🛠️ **Destruction Physics**: Experience realistic crashes and chaotic destruction.
- 🧩 **Block-Based Building**: Craft vehicles with a flexible, customizable system.
- ⚙️ **Advanced Components**: Use thrusters, motors, hinges, and more to bring your creations to life.
- 🧠 **Powerful Logic**: Wire up logic blocks to make your creations do whatever you want, or even write your own Lua code!
- 💻 **Powered by roblox-ts**: Built with a modified [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com) for a first-class TypeScript development experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Development Setup

Get up and running with the OverEngineered development environment in a few steps.

### Prerequisites

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [**Node.js v20 LTS**](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anywaymachines/overengineered.git
    cd overengineered
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install Rokit**
    [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) is required for asset and place management. Choose one of the methods below.

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Recommended (No Rust Required)</strong></summary>

    - **Linux / macOS:**

        ```bash
        curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
        ```

    - **Windows (PowerShell as ADMIN):**

        ```powershell
        Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/main/scripts/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
        ```

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Alternative (Requires Rust/Cargo)</strong></summary>

    - First, install [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
    - Then, install Rokit:

        ```bash
        cargo install rokit
        ```

    </details>

4. **Assemble the Place File**
    Before opening Studio, you must generate the `place.rbxl` file:

    ```bash
    lune run assemble
    ```

5. **Start the Development Server**
    This command launches all necessary services, including the TypeScript compiler and Rojo server.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. **Connect Rojo in Roblox Studio**
    - Open the generated `place.rbxl` file in Roblox Studio.
    - Navigate to **Plugins → Rojo → Connect**.
    - Your local code will now sync automatically with the Studio environment.

You're all set! Make changes in your code editor and watch them appear live in Studio.

> **Note:** When the development server is running, saving assets inside the place will automatically organize all models into their respective folders.
